    <h3>Heuristic Review</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visibility of System Status:</strong> The site does not indicate when a search is being processed or if the system is working in the background. Users may be unsure if their action was registered.</li>
      <li><strong>Match Between System and Real World:</strong> Language used in navigation like “datastream” or “collection” is more suited for librarians or archivists than general users.</li>
      <li><strong>User Control and Freedom:</strong> Once in a PDF document, there is no straightforward way to return to the previous search result page, creating a frustrating loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency and Standards:</strong> The design is uniform throughout, but the lack of labels, tooltips, or standard navigation (like a breadcrumb trail) can disorient users unfamiliar with digital archives.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Prevention:</strong> There are no prompts or auto-correct features to help users avoid or recover from input mistakes such as misspelled queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Recognition Rather Than Recall:</strong> There is no system memory or visible pathway to retrace previous steps or searches. Users have to remember what they searched and manually backtrack.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:</strong> The absence of filters like publication year, topic, or author forces all users to interact in the same linear way, regardless of expertise level.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</strong> The design is simple and not overwhelming, but the lack of call-to-action elements or explanation about how to navigate reduces its effectiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Recovery:</strong> Errors such as invalid searches or navigation to nonexistent pages receive no helpful messages or suggested next steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Help and Documentation:</strong> There is no visible help section, FAQ, or tips built into the user experience. Users are expected to know how to use digital archives or seek outside help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-quality, complete scans of historical student newspapers with good legibility.</li>
      <li>Broad temporal coverage, offering decades of archived material that would be invaluable to researchers.</li>
      <li>Simple layout with minimal distractions and few ads or pop-ups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unintuitive search function with no filtering, preview, or result ranking.</li>
      <li>No content summaries make it difficult to assess which issues are worth opening.</li>
      <li>Users can easily get lost in the navigation without a clear path back.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 2: Mini-Usability Test</h2>

    <h3>Task 1: Explore How the CUA Student Newspaper Has Changed Over the Years</h3>
    <p><strong>Test Scenario:</strong> A student was asked to spend 5 minutes browsing the site to explore how The Tower (Catholic University’s student newspaper) has evolved over time.</p>
    <p><strong>Observed Behavior:</strong> The student used the “Browse This Collection” feature and navigated by decade, looking at issues from the 1920s, 1960s, and 2000s. They relied on PDF previews to scan front pages and identify changes in layout, headlines, and article tone. The student commented that older issues were more text-dense with formal language, while recent issues featured more visual elements and casual language.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues Encountered:</strong> Without summaries or keyword highlights, the student had to rely on manually opening and reading each issue. Navigation was tedious, as returning to the search or collection page required several back-clicks. There were no built-in tools to compare issues side-by-side.</p>
    <p><strong>Emotional Response:</strong> The student found the archive fascinating but expressed frustration with the time it took to browse and the lack of search customization.</p>

    <h3>Task 2: Find Articles on Campus Perspectives Regarding WWII and the Vietnam War</h3>
    <p><strong>Test Scenario:</strong> The student was asked to imagine they were a teacher preparing a lesson on student reactions to World War II and the Vietnam War. They were given 10 minutes to find two relevant articles about each conflict.</p>
    <p><strong>Observed Behavior:</strong> The student searched for “World War II,” “Vietnam War,” and “protest” in the site’s search bar. They browsed through the results and clicked on several issues from the 1940s and 1970s. For WWII, they located an article from 1942 about campus war efforts and another from 1945 about student enlistment. For the Vietnam War, they found a 1969 article discussing anti-war protests and another from 1971 covering student government resolutions.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues Encountered:</strong> The student noted that search results weren’t filtered by decade or relevance. It was difficult to tell which issue contained the relevant content without manually opening and searching inside the PDF. There were no excerpts or content tags to help identify key topics.</p>
    <p><strong>Emotional Response:</strong> The student became slightly overwhelmed and indicated they were unsure whether they had found the “best” articles due to the lack of guidance or filtering tools.</p>

    <h3>Post-Test Reflections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Participants strongly recommended adding summaries and highlighted search terms in results.</li>
      <li>Navigation would benefit from a breadcrumb trail or a persistent sidebar with recently viewed items.</li>
      <li>Advanced filters (by decade, war/conflict, topic) would significantly improve research effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate full-text keyword highlighting and content previews in search results to help users find relevant content quickly.</li>
      <li>Include navigational aids like breadcrumbs, a history tab, or persistent “return to search” buttons.</li>
      <li>Add basic metadata like year, theme tags (e.g., war, protest, sports), and author/editor when available.</li>
      <li>Introduce an “Explore by Topic” feature to allow thematic browsing for common academic research areas.</li>
    </ul>
