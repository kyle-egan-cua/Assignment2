   <h3>Heuristic Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Visibility of System Status:</strong> The site responds quickly when navigating between pages, but there are no visible indicators during loading or search processes. A loading spinner or “searching…” message could help reassure users that the system is processing their request.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Between System and the Real World:</strong> The language and layout mirror the conventions of news websites, using clear and familiar categories like “News,” “Sports,” and “Opinion.” Headlines and dates match what users would expect from a digital newspaper, improving comfort and comprehension.</li>

  <li><strong>User Control and Freedom:</strong> Users can easily return to the homepage or move between categories, and the navigation menu remains consistent throughout the site. However, there's no “back to top” button or undo feature if a user performs an unintended search.</li>

  <li><strong>Consistency and Standards:</strong> The interface is consistent, using the same layout for each article and section page. Links behave as expected, and icons and labels follow standard conventions. Still, the inconsistency in search results presentation (some articles show images, some don’t) may confuse users.</li>

  <li><strong>Error Prevention:</strong> There is no support for misspelled search terms or suggestions for similar keywords. This makes it easy for users to encounter dead ends with no results unless the query is precise.</li>

  <li><strong>Recognition Rather Than Recall:</strong> Users are helped by category labels, headlines, and images that support recognition. However, there is no feature to help recall previously viewed articles, and the lack of breadcrumbs limits user memory of browsing history.</li>

  <li><strong>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:</strong> The site is fine for first-time users but lacks shortcuts or advanced features (e.g., saved searches, filtering, or sorting) that would help power users or researchers find content more efficiently.</li>

  <li><strong>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</strong> The overall design is clean and minimalistic, with good use of white space. However, occasional banner ads can distract from the reading experience, especially when they clash with the visual tone of the rest of the site.</li>

  <li><strong>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:</strong> If a search yields no results, the site gives no feedback or suggestion for next steps. This may frustrate users who don’t understand why their query failed or what to try next.</li>

  <li><strong>Help and Documentation:</strong> There is no obvious help feature, FAQ, or guide for users who may want to understand how to find archives or submit content. While the site is fairly intuitive, more support could assist new users or those with less digital literacy.</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The site has a clean and modern layout with fast-loading pages. Articles are clearly laid out, with intuitive navigation supported by headings, thumbnails, and section labels. The visual consistency across different pages enhances user confidence and familiarity when exploring the site. These strengths make it easy for casual users to explore articles and sections without requiring prior experience with the site.</p>
    <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The search feature is quite basic. It does not offer any filtering or sorting capabilities, which makes it inefficient for users looking for specific information. Search results do not include preview text or publication dates, so users must click into each result to determine its relevance. Accessibility support is limited—text resizing tools, screen reader optimizations, or image alt text are either minimal or missing altogether.</p>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>

    <h2>Part 2: Mini-Usability Test</h2>

    <h3>Task 1: Explore How the Student Newspaper Has Changed Over the Years</h3>
    <p><strong>Test Scenario:</strong> A student was asked to explore how The Tower has changed over time using the website. They were given five minutes to conduct the search.</p>
    <p><strong>Observed Behavior:</strong> The user began by scrolling down the main page of the site, where they noticed a section for archives, broken out by month and year. The user began by selecting March 2025. The user was presented with several articles all with thumbnails. Once an article is selected, the full article is shown with images. One of the other functions of the new articles is the use of hyperlinks to other sources. The user then located the archives and navigated to 2017. The user immediately noticed that many of the articles did not have thumbnails. Once in the article, they were not as pleased as there were no images and hyperlinks.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues Encountered:</strong> This site only goes back less than a decade, and the user attempted to find some ways to get to the older archives from this site, which they were not able to do.</p>
    <p><strong>Emotional Response:</strong> The user became somewhat frustrated, feeling limited in their ability to see the evolution of the paper. They expected a clearer path to browse older content or access special historical collections.</p>

    <h3>Task 2: Find Campus Perspectives on World War II and the Vietnam War</h3>
    <p><strong>Test Scenario:</strong> The user was asked to imagine they were a teacher researching campus perspectives on WWII and the Vietnam War. They were given 10 minutes to locate two articles on each topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Observed Behavior:</strong> The user began by entering "World War II" and "Vietnam" into the search bar. Results were limited, and the search tool did not clearly prioritize relevant articles. The user tried using different keywords such as “Vietnam War campus” or “WWII student reaction.” After some effort, the user located a couple of articles mentioning veterans and ROTC commemorations but had difficulty verifying if they reflected actual student perspectives during the historical time periods.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues Encountered:</strong> The search returned mixed results with no filtering options. Articles about war remembrance events often appeared, but few were direct student-written pieces from the relevant eras. Without the ability to sort by decade or article type, identifying authentic period perspectives was extremely difficult. The lack of article summaries or publication years in the search preview also made it harder to know whether to click.</p>
    <p><strong>Emotional Response:</strong> The user was mildly discouraged. They were interested in the topic but found the website's limitations made this research-heavy task more frustrating than expected.</p>

    <h3>Post-Test Reflections</h3>
    <p>Overall, users appreciated the general layout and ease of exploring current articles but encountered major friction when trying to conduct archival or academic-style research. There is a gap between what the site does well—supporting current campus browsing—and what it lacks, which is long-term content accessibility and robust search tools.</p>

    <h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement filters for search results, including by date, author type, article type, and relevance.</li>
      <li>Create a clearly labeled archive section with a date-based browsing interface and decade filters.</li>
      <li>Add summaries and publication dates in search result previews.</li>
      <li>Develop a help or onboarding section to assist first-time users in navigating the site’s features.</li>
      <li>Enhance accessibility with screen reader support, alt text for images, and text resizing tools.</li>
